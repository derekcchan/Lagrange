Hi there! I'm Derek. I'm an electrical engineer based in Los Angeles, CA. I graduated from [Cal Poly Pomona](https://www.cpp.edu/) with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. I am currently pursuing my master's degree in electrical engineering at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/) with a focus on [VLSI Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Scale_Integration). I love spending my free time messing with technology and coming up with new things to keep me entertained. I also really enjoy traveling and photography. I love to learn and document my experiences with new cultures, people, and food through photography! I also enjoy reading about financial invesntment strategies and trading equity and options on the side.
