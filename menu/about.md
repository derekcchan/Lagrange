# About Me
I am an electrical engineer working at [Northrop Grumman](https://www.northropgrumman.com) and it has been a wonderful experience. I graduated from [Cal Poly Pomona](https://www.cpp.edu/) with a BS in EE. I am currently pursuing my graduate studies at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu) with an emphasis on [VLSI design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Scale_Integration).

I love spending my free time messing with technology and coming up with new things to keep me entertained. I also really enjoy traveling and photography. I love to learn and document my experiences with new cultures, people, and food through photography! I also enjoy reading about financial invesntment strategies and trade equity and options on the side.
